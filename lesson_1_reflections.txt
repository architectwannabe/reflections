How did viewing a differ between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It showed me the comparison between two different files!

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git,
allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others,
like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Git allows saving mutiple files in one commit because
in programming experiences different files interact
dynamically so commiting multiple files is made
possible.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log shows you the ids of all the commits, and git diff shows you the comparison between two

How might using version control make you more
confident to make changes that could 
break something?

git checkout and git diff allow you to 
find found when you made a particualr bug and fit it
by provinding git diff

Now that you have your workspace set up,
what do you want to try using Git for?

I want to become a CTO
